# E-commerce-website
This is a Cypress project, in which I have automated an E-Commerce website to validate things automatically

Description of the Automation:
I when to this website of sourcedemo, Cypress automatically typed user name and password and clicked submit button.
Then we went to the next URL and did assertion on this page such as if the new URL is correct or not.
I inserted two items into the cart and checked if the number of items in the cart is 2 or not.
Then I used assertions to validate if the items which I have choosen is same as what is selected.
We checked out both the items
Wrote the reciever's information
And finished the transaction.
